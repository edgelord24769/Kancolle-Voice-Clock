# Kancolle-Voice-Clock
A fan made project of Kancolle Voice Clock system, WINDOW 10 ONLY

I do not own any of the sound files or any of the arts in this project. All right belongs to Kantai Collection developed by Kadokawa Games and published by DMM.com., NOT ME!

HOWTO:

Clone/download the whole repo as zip, and please unzip everything to the same dir. Run Kancolle.exe. You can also manually set it to start on startup. First, create a shortcute to Kancolle.exe, then press WIN+R to open run and type shell:startup. Then copy and paste the short cute to the folder.

You can exit the program by clicking exit or right click the icon in system stray.
